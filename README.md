# Speaker-Recognition
The project focuses on speaker recogonition techniques. The GMM model used for speaker recognition is trained on a dataset comprising of people of different age groups and gender, speaking in 3 different languages. The trained model can tested by giving a (i) Prerecorded audio file as input (ii) Real time recorded voice as input (iii) Run the entire testing sample and get accuracy of Model.The GMM model is implemented successfully with 92.857 % accuracy.
